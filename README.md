# Weather Dashboard
  Created By: "Brad Webster" - in collaboration with edX coding bootcamp
  ## Description:
  After discovering the wide world of APIs, I was motivated to create my very first full stack application.
  I built this Weather website to get hands on experience from sending and receiving real world data into a custom, purpose built application.
  This website has the functionality of solving a real world problem we face almost everyday: "What's the weather tomorrow?"
  By using openweather.org's API, I was able to learn how to fetch real world data, search it, deconstruct it, and repurpose it in the most user friendly way possible.
